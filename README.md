Galvanize Eats contains two statically hosted pages. The content uses custom CSS and Javascript and allows users to access a site's main content. It also allows users to view and dynamically add items to a checkout cart using jQuery for DOM manipulation. Their are some functionality tweaks to make: dynamically adding to the subtotal with each item added to the cart, form validation for personal information, and issues with `parseFloat` (occasionally working) on the deployed site.
