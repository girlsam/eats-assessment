# Galvanize Eats

**Galvanize Eats** is a food service that delivers burgers and pizza on demand. You're building their new web application which includes a light food ordering system.

The landing page should tell users some basic information about the company. The ordering system should allow users to:

- See a sorted list of menu items
- Add menu items to a shopping cart
- Enter in their delivery information
- Submit the order

Your product owner has created a list of prioritized user stories for you to work down.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone this repository
1. Import [these stories](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lesson-plan-images/galvanize_eats_assessments/Q1+Assessment+Stories.csv) into Pivotal Tracker

Import this [CSV]() into a new project in Pivotal Tracker to get the requirements for this story. They are sorted into two epics that roughly align with the two pages, and they are prioritized. You may find it useful to size the stories before you begin.

### APIs

The project involves two API calls. The first, to get the menu data should be a GET request to this url: [https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu](https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/menu). The second request, to post an order, should be a POST request to this url: [https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders](https://galvanize-eats-api.herokuapp.com/orders).

Your post request should submit the user order. When you have successfully hit the POST api you will see "Congratulations!".

### Notes

* You can use jQuery or plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation
* Does not have to be responsive
* Use feature-branch workflows
* Deploy your work
